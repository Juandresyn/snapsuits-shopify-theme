    "faq-answer-1": "Welcome! <br> <br>We are thrilled that you are considering SnapSuits or just placed your order.  We strive to deliver your garments in just 14 days, but from time to time delays days do occur (holidays and the need for measurement clarifications are the main culprits).  \n<br> <br>SnapSuits will do everything we can to ensure the measurements you submitted are correct.  We will make your garments according to the body measurements you provide, adding ease where appropriate.  With that said, custom suits are more art than science and sometimes a measurement will get submitted incorrectly and we won't catch it before the clothing is made.  Don't be alarmed, we will fix the issue!<br><br>\nAnother common concern is personal preference regarding fit. One man's dream slimming-and-snug suit is another man's nightmare.  While we do our best to nail your preferences using our three sizing options (Classic, Tailored, and Slim) it may not be fully right for you.  Please take advantage of our tailoring credit!  Use up to $50 on us to get the garment altered to your exact preference.  Customers are responsible for their own adjustments above $50.<br><br>\nIf you feel like SnapSuits did not make your suit to the measurements provided please let us know.  We are always trying to grow and better our company, and we can walk through the issues you are facing together.",
    "faq-question-2": "What if I need alterations?",

    "faq-question-5": "How do I get measured?",
    "faq-answer-5": "Great question!  Getting measured for a custom suit online may take a little bit of work, but we promise to make sure its worth it.  You have two options. <li> One use our EZ Tailor and let us calculate your measurements in just about 2 minutes<\/li>\n<li> Two grab a friend and measure yourself at home using our guide and video.<\/li>\n\n<br>Couple of tips when doing the measurements at home.   <br><li>Do them at home! We highly recommend that you <u>do not go to a tailor or your local Men's Wearhouse<\/u>.  Overall these will provide a poor fit and no one wants that.  <\/li>\n<li>Measure carefully, and don't rush.  The measuring tape should never feel tight on your body, nor should it feel loose.  You should be able to move it side to side on the body without it falling down<\/li>\n<li> Don't be alarmed when your pant's waist's measurements don't line up.  Brands use what's called vanity sizing which means the give you a number lower than the true size as a marketing tool (sorry if your bubble is burst here, ours was too!)<\/li>",
    "faq-question-6": "Can you send me a fabric samples before I make a purchase?",
    "faq-answer-6": "Yes. Check out our <a href=\"https:\/\/groomshop.snapsuits.com\/\"><u>swatch request program<\/u><\/a>, fill out the requested information, and we will send swatches to your home.",
    "faq-question-7": "I want to use SnapSuits for a wedding I am in -- can you help me tell the groom to use SnapSuits?",
    "faq-answer-7": "Of course! Send us an email to <a href=\"mailto:support@snapsuits.com\"><u>support@snapsuits.com <\/u><\/a> and we will send you all the details.",
    "faq-question-8": "How long in advance do I have to start my placing my wedding orders?",
    "faq-answer-8": "Although most of our suits ship and deliver a suit in just 14 days, SnapSuits requires that you place your orders for the big day 2 months in advance of the wedding.  This way all your product arrives 6 weeks in advance of the wedding just in case we need to solve any minor fit issues we have plenty of time without stressing anyone out and making sure everyone has a perfect fit for your big day.",
